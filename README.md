## Overview
SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is a method used in linear algebra to decompose a matrix into three simpler matrices, making it easier to analyze and manipulate.

U: This part tells you about the people (like their general preferences). \
Œ£: This part shows how important each factor is (how much each rating matters).\
V·µÄ: This part tells you about the products (how similar they are to each other)

Name    | A   | B|
|-------|-----|-----|
| 1| 5  | 3   |
| 2| 4  | 2   |
| 3| 2  | 5   |

SVD breaks this table into three smaller parts: one that shows people‚Äôs preferences, one that shows the importance of each movie, and one that shows how similar the movies are to each other
Mathematically, the SVD of a matrix A (of size m√ón) is represented as:
```bash
 A = UŒ£V·µÄ
 ```

## The core of this program
1. Input image with png type
2. Form RGB channels \
-> we have R, G, B channels as matrices \
3. Use SVD algorithm to compress each channel
call the channels respectively R, G, B.
4. Select compression level
ùëò
GUI: enter coefficient k to compress.
5. Merge those channels and save them in image format with <name>_compressed.png
---
## How to use it
1. Run python code in GUI.py in SourceCode folder
2. Choose any photo with png type to compress
3. Input the K value in range [1,300] (Depending how strong your computer is, keep waiting until It's done, dont quit, dont give up like the way you spy on your crush ;3)
4. The compressed photo will be located in your SourceCode folder, you can change in it by modify the GUI.py if you want 
5. That's it!
